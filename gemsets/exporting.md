# Exporting gemsets

You can not only use completely separate gemsets per application/project/etc...
you can also export and load them very easily, too.

To export a gemset, assuming a project called 'teddy' running on Ruby 2.1.1:

```
$ rvm 2.1.1@teddy do gemset export
```

creates an 'teddy.gems' file.

Alternatively, if you already have a ruby selected

```
rvm gemset export
```

creates a 'default.gems' file.

You can specify the gemset filename prefix, also

```
rvm gemset export teddy.gems
```
A subtle difference with the above command is to leave off the '.gems' which
will export the gems for the gemset named 'mygemsetname' unclear what happens
here. if the example used 'rosie', I'd interpret this as "although gem set teddy
is currently in use, this command will export the not-in-use gem set 'rosie',
perhaps to the export file 'rosie.gems'"

```
rvm gemset export teddy
```
