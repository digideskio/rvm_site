# Contributing to RVM

So, you want to contribute to rvm? Excellent! We can always do with an extra
helping hand (or two). If you're not a great coder, we always appreciate people
helping out in the channel, and giving support. If you are interested in coding,
there are a few things you'll need to know - and a few things that make the
process in general a lot smoother.

We also greatly appreciate documentation patches, submitted from the rvm-site
repository.

## General Guidelines

1. Read the
[How to hack on RVM](https://github.com/rvm/rvm/blob/master/HACKING.md) guide.
It explains how to setup a second copy of RVM to allow you to hack without
disturbing your primary RVM installation and how to use the RVM test suite.

1. When contributing, either keep patches small and clear, or work on a topic
branch - this makes it easier for us to merge in discrete changes, and means
you always keep things separate where needed.

1. The code has to be compatible with bash, and takes an almost git-like design
architecturally.  Many actions (e.g. aliases) call out to a script in the
~/.rvm/scripts directory. For an example of the new, simplified style for coding
these, make sure you check out:
  * scripts/snapshot
  * scripts/repair
  * scripts/tools

1. *Clean* code is preferred - if in doubt, take a look back, and refactor.

1. Visit our IRC channel #rvm on freenode and ask if you have a task in mind.
You may find someone else has already started on it.

If you're interested in helping out, but don't have something specific in mind,
check out the
[rvm pivotal tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/26822").

## Handy Tips

* Generally, working in a clone of the repository is by far the best way to go.
When you need to test out something on a fresh install, install a new RVM to a
separate path, then use `rvm switch ...` to use it.  This is discussed in the
[hacking guide](https://github.com/rvm/rvm/blob/master/HACKING.md).

```
$ ./install --path $HOME/.rvm-dev
$ rvm switch $HOME/.rvm-dev
```

* It helps to use bash as your primary shell, but for some features you'll want
to have zsh installed as well, to ensure compatibility.

## Repositories
