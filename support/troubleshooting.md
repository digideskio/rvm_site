# Troubleshooting

Here we will explore common issues and their resolutions.

**Before trying any solution below, please verify the following**

* Make sure that you are on the latest RVM version by executing

```
rvm get stable
```

    or, if you are more adventurous,

```
rvm get head
```

* Make sure that the sourcing of the RVM file occurs *last* in your shell
configuration files (.bash_profile /.bash_profile / .zshrc) especially after any
customizations of your $PATH, functions or aliases.
* Ensure your files do not contain "&amp;&amp; return".
* Be sure to be using either Bash or Zsh. RVM is untested, at best, in other
shells.

## Multi-User Installs - Using the sudo command
The installation process is similar for both installation methods, however, when
installing a multi-user configuration, **do not run the installer directly
*as/from* the 'root' account!** Always use the sudo command from a
non-privileged user account. This is due to variables that are different between
root's environment and a user's that aren't affected by an EUID change, as well
as code checks in the install itself. In addition, using sudo will not load the
/etc/profile.d/rvm.sh, which exists for current installs, and as such will not
load RVM. You can prove this to yourself by executing:

```
sudo printenv | grep -i rvm
```

Also, you only use the sudo command during the install process. In Multi-User
configurations, any operations which require sudo access must use the rvmsudo
command which preserves the RVM environment and passes this on to sudo. However,
please note that are *very few cases* where rvmsudo is required *at all* once
the core install is completed! Updating RVM itself is not one of them. Any user
in the rvm group can update RVM, rubies, and gemsets. There is **never** a
reason to use sudo post-install.

Once any user(s) added to the 'rvm' group have logged out then back in to gain
rvm group membership, they will be able to execute

```
rvm get head
```

or

```
rvm get stable
```

to update RVM itself. They will also be able to install any Ruby listed in

```
rvm list known
```

as well as upgrade existing rubies, and create gemsets. Users **not**
in the rvm group will only be able to make use of, but not be able to modify,
RVM. This includes adding or modifying the 'trust' on project .rvmrc files.


Note: Users **must** log out and back in to gain rvm group membership because
group memberships are only evaluated by the operating system at initial login
time.

## ruby-debug and ruby 1.9

If you have trouble installing ruby-debug19 try installing with the following
command:

```
$ rvm reinstall 1.9.3 --patch debug --force-autoconf
$ gem install ruby-debug19 -- --with-ruby-include="${MY_RUBY_HOME/rubies/src}"
```
## I keep getting callback.func errors with Ruby 1.8.7

This is usually caused by using pre-release compilers. In this case, this
usually shows up under gcc-4.6. This issue does not take place with gcc-4.5. It
is suggested you install gcc-4.5 and add the variable

```
CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.5
```

to your $rvm_path/environments/[ruby_version_string] file. Most people will find
this problem when using ArchLinux. **NOTE: We do NOT support pre-release
compilers of any kind.**

## i386 (32 bit)

I need to compile ruby X as i386 (32 bit).

```
CFLAGS='-m32' CXXFLAGS='-m32' LDFLAGS='-m32' rvm install X
```

Also note on OSX it is enough to use:

```
rvm install X --32
```

## Bus Error / Segfault

When a command you try to run produces a segfault, possibly like the one below:

```
[BUG] cross-thread violation on rb_gc()
```

In every case of this I have seen thus far it has always ended up being that a
ruby gem/library with C extensions was compiled against a different ruby and/or
architecture than the one that is trying to load it. Try uninstalling &
reinstalling gems with C extensions that your application uses to hunt this
bugger down.

## MySQL

If you are having issues installing MySQL gem for a ruby please visit the
[MySQL page](/integration/databases/).

## .bash_profile not being loaded on OSX

If your .bash_profile isn't being correctly loaded on OSX, you need to do one of
three things:

* Create a file named ~/.bash_profile and add the RVM source line there
* Add the RVM source line to ~/.profile
* In your terminal preferences, change the shell from the default of
/usr/bin/login to /bin/bash.

## Passenger

If you are having issues getting passenger running with an RVM installed ruby,
most likely you missed the '.bin/[ruby string]' comment on the
[passenger page](/integration/passenger/).

## Readline

If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, please refer to the
[readline page](/packages/readline/).

## require "iconv" # => false ?!

If you have issues with iconv not being available in ruby / irb please rever to
the [iconv page](/packages/iconv/).

## curl failing, 'curl is' ?!

If you see this:

```
++ curl is /opt/local/bin/curl -O -L -s -C - ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6-p383.tar.gz
curl: Remote file name has no length!
curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information

Then maybe you have aliased or symlinked the 'which' command to the 'type'
command, revert this and RVM should work.

## I can't seem to install the pg gem.

Prepend with a variable assignment for PATH with the location of the pg_config
file, for example:

```
PATH=/usr/local/bdsm/pkg/postgresql/active/bin:$PATH gem install pg --no-rdoc --no-ri
```

## I'm having trouble in Bash with tab completion of cd (and maybe $CDPATH)

rvm hooks into cd in order to do per-directory checks for '.rvmrc' files. Tab
completion of directories should still work, but some people have reported
problems. If tab completion was working *before* you installed rvm and now it's
not, you can enable cd completion from within rvm itself.

Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile as appropriate:

```
export rvm_cd_complete_flag=1
```

If you have this problem, please report the details of your operating system,
$BASH_VERSION, the version of bash_completion you're using, etc. to #rvm on
Freenode or on Github. To be honest, the tab completion for cd in
bash_completion is far more robust than the code in rvm's cd function, and
*should* still work with rvm. (In fact, it *does* still work on OSX 10.6 with
Bash 3.2 and Bash 4, on OpenBSD 4.7 with Bash 4 and on Debian 5.0.6 with
Bash 3.2. All of those were tested with the
[most up-to-date bash-completion](http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org/). If
you don't have that, you may want to try it.) Nevertheless, some people have
reported problems, and the cd completion inside rvm has helped them.

## Building an interpreter fails with an error related to RDOC

Occasionally a build will fail because the build process picks up an an
existing rdoc in your path. If this happens, you can add a configuration
option that will prevent the documentation being built during installation:

```
rvm install <ruby-version> --disable-install-doc
```

Alternatively, you can try installing a newer version of rdoc to the current
environment. That way, the newer rdoc should be able to handle documentation
from the more recent version of Ruby that you're installing.

## How do I completely clean out all traces of RVM from my system, including for
system wide installs?

Here is a custom script which we name as 'cleanout-rvm'. While you can
definitely use 'rvm implode' as a regular user or 'rvmsudo rvm implode' for a
system wide install, this script is useful as it steps completely outside of RVM
and cleans out RVM without using RVM itself, leaving no traces.

```
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/sudo rm -rf $HOME/.rvm $HOME/.rvmrc /etc/rvmrc /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh /usr/local/rvm /usr/local/bin/rvm
/usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/groupdel rvm
/bin/echo "RVM is removed. Please check all .bashrc|.bash_profile|.profile|.zshrc for RVM source lines and delete
or comment out if this was a Per-User installation."
```

## I'm using zsh+oh-my-zsh and it keeps trying to use the system Ruby for
rubygems.

Check to see if you have the bundler plugin enabled in oh-my-zsh. Do a

```
set -x ; cd $some_project ; set -x
```

Look in the output for 'within-bundled-project'. If you see that edit your
.zshrc and remove the bundler plugin from the 'plugins=()' line, then log out of
the shell and back in. Should all work now. The bundler plugin in oh-my-zsh
overrides RVM's settings related to RubyGems for some reason.
