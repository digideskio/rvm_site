# Using RVM to Manage Rubies for SketchUp

[Google SketchUp](http://sketchup.google.com/) is a free 3d modelling tool made
available by Google. As part of SketchUp, there is ability to script the
environment using Ruby.

Unfortunately, the bundled environment currently ships with a restricted subset
of the full standard lib and more importantly, it is tied to 1.8.5.

Hence, by following the instructions linked in "Community Resources" it is
possible to compile a new version of 1.8.5 to use with SketchUp (with thanks to
  Rich Morin for doing the work to document process).
