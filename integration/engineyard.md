# Using RVM with EngineYard AppCloud

[EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com/)
[AppCloud](http://www.engineyard.com/products/appcloud) is a deployment platform
for running rails application on a scalable architecture.

EngineYard provides a managed environment of pre-configured instances setup to
run rails applications and does not currently provide a mechanism for running
RVM on those instances. However RVM remains a useful tool for managing
development machines and making sure that development and test environments
match the environment on AppCloud instances.

You can follow changes to the AppCloud stack on Twitter:
