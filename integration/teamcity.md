# Continuous Integration with TeamCity

TeamCity is a continuous integration server designed to automatically run tests
against a project every time you make a change. You can configure TeamCity to
automatically commit changes to version control when your tests pass or deploy
your changes to a remote environment. By integrating rvm with TeamCity you can
run tests against multiple ruby versions and test multiple projects with each
project working with an independent set of gems.

## General Overview

In order to run TeamCity with RVM you will need to

* Setup a TeamCity server which manages your builds and serves a web interface
so you can monitor and control the build process.
* Run one or more separate build agent processes which actually perform the
builds and run your tests. These build agents can be located on the same machine
as the TeamCity server or connect from remote machines.
* Specify the Ruby and Gemset you want the build agent to use as part of your
project's configuration on the TeamCity server.

## Installing TeamCity

## Configuring a TeamCity Project

[Managing TeamCity Projects](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD5/Managing+Projects)

### Setting Up Build Agents

Install the project's Ruby and Gemset on the build agent's machine. This can
either be performed manually on each build agent machine or as a command line
build runner as long as it is completed on each build agent's environment before
the agent attempts to build a project using RVM.

### Configuring a Build Agent to use RVM

#### Using a Rake Build Runner

TeamCity 5.1.3 includes support for RVM settings in the Rake Build Runner. In
the Build Runner's "Launching Parameters" set the following options:

* The "Ruby interpreter path" can be any RVM Ruby installed on the build runner.
(eg '1.9.2')
* The "RVM gemset name" can be any RVM Gemset in the specified Ruby.

#### Using a Command Line Build Runner

As of TeamCity 5.1.3 Command Line build runners do not have built in support for
RVM however they can use RVM given appropriate environment variables. The
example below demonstrates running "bundle install" using a Command Line Build
Runner.

##### In the Build Runner Configuration Step

* Set the "Build Runner" to "Command Line"
* Set the "Command Executable" to "~/.rvm/gems/%rvm.ruby%@%rvm.gemset%/bin/bundle"
* Set the "Command parameters" to "install"

##### In the Properties and Environment Variables Configuration Step

Add the following two "Configuration Parameters". Setting these values as
configuration parameters allows them to be reused in the Build Runner
Configuration and the Environment Variables below.

| Name | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| rvm.ruby | Your project's Ruby |
| rvm.gemset | Your project's Gemset |

Add the following Environment Variables to the "Build Parameters"

| Name | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| BUNDLE_PATH | ~/.rvm/gems/%rvm.ruby%@%rvm.gemset% |
| GEM_HOME | ~/.rvm/gems/%rvm.ruby%@%rvm.gemset% |
| GEM_PATH | ~/.rvm/gems/%rvm.ruby%@%rvm.gemset%:/home/teamcity/.rvm/gems/%rvm.ruby%@global |
| PATH | /.rvm/bin:~/.rvm/rubies/%rvm.ruby%/bin:~/.rvm/gems/%rvm.ruby%@%rvm.gemset%/bin:~/.rvm/gems/%rvm.ruby%@global/bin:%env.PATH% |

Using either of the configurations above the build agents will be able to
reference an RVM Ruby and Gemset when performing their builds.
