# Integrating RVM with Konsole

Before you install RVM you need to change the Command field in your profile
settings. Go to Settings >> Edit Current Profile and add a space and then
--login to the end of /bin/bash. It should go from this:

```
/bin/bash
```

To this:

```
/bin/bash --login
```

For more information on what this means, please read the explanation regarding
[Shell logins](/support/faq/#shell_login) especially if you are in doubt, or
advised by other sites to not use it.
