# Fish Shell

Since RVM is a large collection of bash scripts and fish is not
bash-compatible, users of fish need a wrapper around RVM to make it work
properly with that shell. Since RVM just manipulates environment
variables, we just need a way to preserve those changes.

Please note that better fish support (although not native) is expected
in the future.

## Install

[Install RVM](/rvm/install/) as you would for use with bash. When
running the `rvm-install` command, feel free to ignore the advice under
the "You must now finish the install manually" section.

## Setup

Download the fish functions from GitHub.

```
curl -L --create-dirs -o ~/.config/fish/functions/rvm.fish https://raw.github.com/lunks/fish-nuggets/master/functions/rvm.fish
```

## Usage

Use RVM just as you would in bash or zsh as per the instructions on the
website, converting any bashisms to fish as needed.

## Alternative

Code: https://gist.github.com/eggegg/6077153

Insert the first one into your own `config.fish`, then copy `rvm.fish`
to `~/.config/fish/functions/` will do the tricks.
