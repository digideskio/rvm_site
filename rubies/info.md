# RVM Ruby Environment Information

If you are coding scripts and/or configuring text editors or similar tools then
often it is useful to be able to inspect the entire ruby environment for a
specified RVM installed ruby.

In order to inspect the environment of the currently selected Ruby,

```
$ rvm info
```

In order to inspect the environment of a specific Ruby, pass a valid selector
representing it as the first parameter:

```
$ rvm info 2.1.1
```
