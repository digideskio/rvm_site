# Listing RVM installed rubies.

There are a few different ways to list RVM installed rubies.

You can view the commands available by typing

```
$ rvm list
```

To list all installed rubies

```
$rvm list rubies
```

To list the default ruby

```
$ rvm list default
```

To list the default ruby string only

```
$ rvm list default string
```

To list all installed rubies, in their ruby string representation only

```
$rvm list strings
```

To list all *known* RVM installable Rubies

```
$ rvm list known
```

NOTE: Even though this is all *known* rubies, RVM can install many more rubies
not listed :)
