# Patching Rubies

As a side effect of RVM it is very easy to test patches with many versions of
ruby.

Installing specific rubies with custom ruby source patches

```
$ rvm install 2.1.1 --patch /path/to/awesome.patch
```

Alternatively you can specify more than one patch, they are applied in the order
given.

```
$ rvm install 2.1.1 --patch /path/to/awesome.patch,/path/to/another.patch
```

Starting with RVM 1.17 it is also possible to specify an URL to a patch

```
$ rvm install 2.1.1 --patch https://url.to.your/fancy.patch
```

It is also possible to specially name a patched ruby (see
[Named Rubies](/rubies/named/) for more details).

```
$ rvm install 2.1.1-named --patch /path/to/weird.patch
```

# Contributing patches
## Testing patches
### Functionality improvements

Test ruby before patching

```
$ rvm install 2.1.1
$ ruby your_test.rb #or
$ ruby -e "puts 'your one line test'"
```

Uninstall previous version before installing with patch

```
$ rvm remove 2.1.1
```

Test ruby after patching

```
$ rvm install 2.1.1 --patch /path/to/awesome.patch
$ ruby your_test.rb #or
$ ruby -e "puts 'your one line test'"
```

### Compilation errors

Test ruby after patching

```
$ rvm install 2.1.1 --patch /path/to/compilation.patch
$ ruby -v
```

## Contributing patches

If your patch fixes important issues on old branches like 2.0.0 it can be
contributed to RVM. But first talk with somebody, before you start preparing
your contribution check out what other think about it, some changes aren't right
for everybody and shouldn't be contributed. Best way is to use
[IRC](/support/irc/) and ask a questions about your patch.

It might appear that your patch is to awesome for everybody and you should keep
it as your own vendor extension **vendor/ruby-patches/my-awesome.patch**, and
always use **--patch** option.

To start you need to fork [wayneeseguin/rvm](http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm)
clone your fork to disk, and add your patch to right directory like:
**patches/ruby/2.0.0/**

## Install your version of RVM into system

Backup original RVM installation

```
$ mv $HOME/.rvm $HOME/.rvm-backup
```

Install extended RVM (from your checked out fork directory)

```
$ ./install
```
Install ruby which should be automatically patched, test as needed

```
$ rvm install 2.1.1
$ ruby -v #or
$ ruby your_test.rb #or
$ ruby -e "puts 'your one line test'"
```

remove test rvm installation, restore backup

```
$ rm -rf $HOME/.rvm
$ mv $HOME/.rvm-backup $HOME/.rvm
```

When the code is ready and tested:

1. Commit your code, don't miss a thing.
1. push changes to github.
1. order a pull request
