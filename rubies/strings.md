# Ruby String

RVM uses the concept of a 'ruby string' to uniquely identify each interpreter
installation. Most commonly this is of the form
$interpreter-$version-$distinguisher. For example 'ruby-1.9.1-p378' stands for
"Ruby 1.9.1 patch level 378".

If you are developing tools which use RVM and you need a way to expand ruby selectors to their full ruby strings then you can do it like so:

```
rvm strings 1.8.7
```

This will produce output similar to:

```
ruby-1.8.7-p249
```

You may also pass multiple selectors:

```
rvm strings 1.8.7 1.9.1 jruby
```

Which yields something like,

```
ruby-1.8.7-p249 ruby-1.9.1-p378 jruby-1.4.0
```

## Overriding Defaults

RVM tracks the latest stable patchlevels for each release.  If you want to
override this, for example, so you could make '1.8.7' to resolve to
'ruby-1.8.7-p302' instead of the latest patchlevel, you can edit the config/user
file, which will override the settings in config/db and persist across installs
and updates of rvm itself.
